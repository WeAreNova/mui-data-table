An extensive data-table with sorting, multi-column filtering, pagination and more with server-side data fetching support.

**Further documentation coming soon!**

In the mean time, you can look at `dev/src/utils.tsx` for how the demo table structure is defined.

You can also look at the types in `lib/src/` for more information.
